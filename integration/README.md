# Integration Layout

This folder separates supporting material for:

- FIDO2 applet with PRF support (integration/fido2_prf)
- Satochip MuSig2 applet (integration/satochip_musig2)

Use these docs and scripts when preparing a clean upstream merge or for local demos.

See also:
- `integration/MANIFEST.md` for a list of key files and branches
- `integration/CHANGELOG.md` to track integration work across applets
